# color-swapper

This is a simple program written in Rust that, as the name suggests, swaps the colors of an SVG file, in theory.

The reality is that this accepts any UTF8 text file and replaces a given text with another one. It then saves the result in the generated output directory.

### Why ?

This could probably be done in 1 command in UNIX systems, but I wanted to learn Rust and this seemed like a good little project to start with.

### How to use
